URitality
========

URitality is a plugin that makes Vim play nicely with URxvt and tmux.

Features
--------

URitality changes the cursor colors when you enter/leave insert mode, even if
it's inside tmux!

Pull requests for other helpful behavior are welcome.

Installation and Usage
----------------------

Use Pathogen to install.

You shouldn't need to do anything else, but you can read `:help uritality` if
you're curious.

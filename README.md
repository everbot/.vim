###A calculator inside Vim

##Overview

Crunch makes calculations in Vim more accessible and loosens Vim's math
syntax.  Most of Crunch's looser syntax is accomplished by extensive search
and replace.  Crunch also forces floating point to be used.

Crunch allows you to just type in mathematical expressions without having to
worry about the syntax as much.

##Requirements
* [selection.vim](https://github.com/arecarn/selection.vim)
* Vim compiled with `+float` feature.

##Usage

* `g={motion}` Evaluate the text that {motion} moves over

* `g==` Evalue the current line appending the result

* `:[range]Crunch[!]`
   Evaluates the current visual selection or provided range and adds result to
   the end of the line(s) With the [!] crunch does not append the result but
   replaces the provided range or visual selection with the result this
   behavior can be reversed  by setting  `g:crunch_result_type_append` = 0

* `:Crunch`
    Provides a prompt in the command for you to enter your mathematical
    expression. The result is then available to be pasted from the default
    register.

* `:Crunch [expr]`
    Where [expr] is some mathematical expression to be evaluated. The result
    is then available to be pasted from the default register.

##Looser Syntax

The following chart shows the looser math syntax provided with Crunch,
compared to the default math syntax.

|       **Feature**         |    **With Crunch**      |  **Without Crunch** |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------   | ------------------- |
|Implied Multiplication     |                         |                     |
|                           |`cos(0)cos(0) = 1`       |`cos(0)*cos(0) = 1.0`|
|                           |`2sin(1) = 11.682942`    |`2*sin(1) = 1.682942`|
|                           |`sin(1)2 = 1.682942`     |`sin(1)*2 = 1.682942`|
|                           |`(2*3)(3*2) = 36`        |`(2*3)*(3*2) = 36`   |
|                           |`2(3*2) = 12`            |`2*(3*2) = 12`       |
|Integer to Float Conversion|                         |                     |
|                           |`1/2 = 0.5`              |`1.0/2.0 = 0.5`      |
|                           |`.25*4 = 1`              |`0.25*4 = 1.0`       |
|Decimals w/o Leading Zeros |                         |                     |
|                           |`.5/2 = 0.25`            |`0.5/2 = 0.25`       |
|                           |`.25*4 = 1`              |`0.25*4 = 1.0`       |
|Removed Zeros In Result    |                         |                     |
|                           |`0.25*4 = 1`             |`0.25*4 = 1.0`       |
|                           |`pow(2,8) = 256`         |`pow(2,8)= 256.0`    |
